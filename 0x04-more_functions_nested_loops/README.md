This Directory is about more tasks on functions and nested loops.
script 0- function that checks for uppercase character.
script 1- function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
script 2- function that multiplies two integers.
script 3- function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
script 4- function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Do not print 2 and 4
script 5- function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
script 6- function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
            . Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
            . The line should end with a \n
            . If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n
script 7- function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
            . Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
            . The diagonal should end with a \n
            . If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n
script 8- function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
            . Where size is the size of the square
            . If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
            . Use the character # to print the square
 script 9- a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz                instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and            five print FizzBuzz.
 script 10- a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
            . Where size is the size of the triangle
            . If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
            . Use the character # to print the triangle
 script 11-  a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
 script 12-   a function that prints an integer.
              . Prototype: void print_number(int n);
              . You can only use _putchar function to print
              . You are not allowed to use long
              . You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
              . You are not allowed to hard-code special values
